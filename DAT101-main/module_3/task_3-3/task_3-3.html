      <li>What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</li>
<p>Creating a function means defining it with a name and code inside it, but it doesnt run yet. Invoking a function means actually calling it so that it runs and does what it's meant to do.</p>

<li>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</li>
<p>Semicolons are used to end statements in JavaScript, but code blocks (like functions or loops) are wrapped in curly braces { }. You don't need a semicolon right after a code block, only after each statement inside it.</p>

<li>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</li>
<p>If a function doesnt return anything, trying to store its result will give undefined. This means theres no actual value to store because the function didnt produce one.</p>

<li>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</li>
<p>When creating a function, we separate parameters with commas inside the parentheses, like function myFunc(param1, param2).</p>

<li>Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</li>
<p>The parameter names in the function definition act as placeholders. When we invoke the function, the values we pass replace those placeholders in the functions code.</p>

<li>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</li>
<p>If a function call is missing a parameter, the function's code tries to use a value that wasnt given, so it becomes undefined by default.</p>

<li>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</li>
<p>Recursive functions call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. This allows them to solve problems by breaking them into smaller, similar sub-problems.</p>
