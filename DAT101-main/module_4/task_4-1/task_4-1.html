        <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
        <p>Object-oriented development is important because it allows us to organize code around objects, which can represent real-world entities and make complex systems more manageable. By using classes and objects, we can create reusable, modular code, making it easier to maintain and extend. It also supports principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which improve code structure and flexibility.</p>

          <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
          <p>Object-oriented development is important because it helps organize code by using objects to represent real-world things. This makes code easier to manage, reuse, and update.</p>
        
          <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
          <p>"AccountType" is used to store types like "Savings" and "Checking." It keeps our code cleaner by avoiding hardcoded values, so we only need to update account types in one place.</p>
        
          <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
          <p>Encapsulation hides details of a class, making it easier to control how data is accessed or changed. We create private members using "#" or closures, while public members are just added normally in the constructor.</p>
        
          <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript</li>
          <p>The "new" command creates a new object using a constructor. It links the new object to the prototype, binds "this" to the new object, and returns the object.</p>
